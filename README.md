# PinguiN - Styles for plug.dj

[Plug.DJ](https://plug.dj/) is a great site to listen to music. There are also a big community. You can chat with them all the days.

I am creating some Custom CSS for this site. But first you have to install [RCS](https://rcs.radiant.dj/).

I'm not creating new CSS Themes anymore but maybe one time... I'll come back with something new. :-)

### Copyright

I can not prevent my projects but if you are not a dumb :smile: you can know that it takes a lot of time doing CSS's so my projects are free for all. I am making a some "ad" there so if you want to "support" me you can let it without editing. Thank you for understanding.
