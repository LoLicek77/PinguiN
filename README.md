# PinguiN - Styles for plug.dj

[Plug.DJ](https://plug.dj/) is a great site to listen to music. There are also big communities of great people. You can chat with them all day.

I am creating some Custom CSS for this site because I like CSS Programming language. You are free to use my themes but first you have to install [RCS](https://rcs.radiant.dj/).

**UPDATE:** Added new design! It's remaked Glass Design and Blue Nature! Hope you enjoy! [BlueGlassy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LoLicek77/plugCSS/master/themes/blueGlassy2018.css)

### Copyright

I can not prevent my projects from being stolen and remaked but if you are not a dumb :-) you may know that it takes a lot of time doing CSS. Anyway my projects are free for all. I am making some "ad" there so if you want to "support" me you can let it without editing. Thank you for understanding.
